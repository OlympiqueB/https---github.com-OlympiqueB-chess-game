## About the project

This was the first app I've ever coded with React/JS. The goal was to jump straight into it without any planning, ready to make as many mistakes as possible. The goal was achieved.

The game covers all rules of chess (except move-repetition). Calling the design 'simple' is accurate, but my main objective was the logic behind the game.

I have learned a lot from this.
